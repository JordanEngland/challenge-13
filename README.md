# 13 Object-Relational Mapping (ORM): E-Commerce Back End

## Description

The project is a web application that serves as an e-commerce platform. It allows users to browse and purchase various products, including shirts, shorts, music, hats, and shoes. The application provides features such as product categorization, product tagging, and product management. Users can view product details, add items to their shopping cart, and proceed to the checkout process. This project was on the more difficult side as im still having troubles with how to use insomnia. i'm sure with more time ill get better with it. Hope you enjoy!!
